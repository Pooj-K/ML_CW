A simple classification problem - that of labelling emails as spam or non-spam, based on their content in terms of words using two machine learning models based on K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees

One of the most widely utilized ways of communication in the modern day is email. Regrettably, email spam is an issue that keeps getting worse. Spam emails are unsolicited messages that are sent to many people and frequently with the intention of making a sale. Machine learning algorithms can be used for the task of recognizing spam emails. In this study, we will investigate the usage of KNN and Decision Tree models to identify emails as spam or not.
